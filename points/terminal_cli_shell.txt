Terminal = Tool that you use to type and execute commands.
           Used to be hardware, now we use "terminal emulator" software

Command line = The interface of the terminal. Windows often calls
               their terminal program the "command line" ("command prompt").
               The two terms are used interchangeably

The Shell = The program that the terminal runs. The "OS" of the terminal
